[[The Plague]] was a necrotic virus that was spread by the necromancer [[General Malachi|Malachi]]. It caused the recently deceased to rise from the dead as zombies with their souls still affixed to them. [[The Plague]] caused a great divide in [[The Basin]], with many people seeing the undead as monsters. The [[League of Arathor]] to this day sees the undead as the same monsters that killed many of their kin.
