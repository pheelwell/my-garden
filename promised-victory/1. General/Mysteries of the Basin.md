Alongside the gathering of the Artifacts the player will be able to solve some mysteries and secrets of [[The Basin]].

## Origin of [[the Shaddowhammer]]

The party can learn about the and Origin of [[the Shaddowhammer]] and [[Volar]], their founder.

[[Volar]] was once a Paladin in the ranks of the [[League of Arathor]].

The [[League of Paranormal Researchers]] secretly killed his daughter to find out more about the [[Nosem]].
This led to him being seduced by the Fullfiller, a hag that wants to revive [[Naruun]].

She promisses him [[Naruun]] will be able to revive his daughter, but in reality he only leads to the freeing of the old God.

[[Volar]] starts with joining [[Founder1]] and [[Founder2]] to found the [[Cult of the Gifted Ones]] 

The Party can learn, that [[Volar]] is actualy blinded by his grief and maybe can stop him by confronting him with the truth.

## Origin of the [[Stoalium]]

All over the lands of [[The Basin]] you can find round tubical Caves that go deeper and deeper into the earth. In those Caves you can find a metal called [[Stoalium]] that sits bare in the center of the cave and is anchored through little tendrils to the wall of the cave.

In short, who controls the [[Stoalium]] supplies, has the upper hand in the Battle for [[The Basin]]. Because of that, for both sides, Controlling the [[Mines of Torrar]], [[Herbstbog]] and [[Edschmied]] is the Key to Wining the war.

In reality [[Stoalium]] is the remans of the nerves of [[Naruun]] and the power bolstering properties wear off at the most Ciritcal Moment.
This leads to the endless war going back and fourth. With one party pusshing right to the enemys gate, but then loosing by a sudden turn of events.

The party can learn, that the [[Stoalium]] is the reason for this unending loop, that they can use to end the conflict once and for all.

## Killing [[Naruun]]

[[Naruun]] is a an old god of false promisses that can not be killed by conventional means.

If the party manages to save [[Volar]] from the hag that seduced him, he will join the party and show them how to kill [[Naruun]] for good.
With the [[Stoalium]] metal and the power of a Titanforge they can sund the energy of a soulstone into [[Naruun]] and bind him to the world.
