Promises of Victory is a Campain set in [[The Basin]], a Region currently in war, lead by the **[[League of Arathor]]** and the **[[Defilers]]**.

In the Background [[the Shaddowhammer]] clan is **trying to free the old god of false promisses [[Naruun]]**, who is sealed deep underground in the middle of [[The Basin]].

To do that, the Shadowhammer needs are in the process of collecting 3 Artifacts that were used to seal the old god

- The **Heart of the forrest**, the [[Artifact of Life]]
- The **Tear of the Archdevil**, the [[Artifact of Chaos]]
- **Sundawn**, the [[Artifact of Light]]

They need to bring the Artifacts to 3 different aincient Machineries called **Titanforges** and fuel the Jail **with a vast amount of soul energy**.

The gathering of soul energy has been the main activity of [[the Shaddowhammer]] but they got **nearly enought** to start the ritual.

The party has to find the artifacts to maybe alter the ritual and kill [[Naruun]] for good, while not also falling to the false promisses of the old god.

## Structure

## Ending

The more Artifacts the player stops [[the Shaddowhammer]] from collecting, the harder it will be for them to revive [[Naruun]].

If the player manages to stop [[the Shaddowhammer]] from reviving [[Naruun]] and kill [[Volar]], the fullfiller and [[Naruun]].

The end of the conflict will be in sight, if the player can explain to both sides, [[the Shaddowhammer]] and the [[Defilers]] the [[Stoalium]] metal is the cause of the endless conflict and they can use it to end the war.

If the player manages to do that they can choose to have both sides unite and rule over [[The Basin]] as one.
