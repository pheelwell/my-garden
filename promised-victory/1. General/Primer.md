You stand atop a hill, surrounded by war. Archers and swordsmen swarm, fighting against soldiers now turned wild. Ahead lies victory – but as you gaze upon the battle, a new thought strikes you. What if this is not what it seems?
An evil hangs over these lands. It whispers while scheming in the shadows…

War is nothing new for the inhabitants of [[The Basin]].

It is rare to meet a child who has not lost at least one parent, or is even a sage.

The war, which has been going on for 5 years now, still seems to have no end, despite many victories. At the center of the war are the many resources of [[The Basin]], which both the Horde and the Alliance want to claim as their own. Both the Arathor Alliance, who see the undead as parasites infesting their land, and the Desecrated, who are eager to wipe out every last human in [[The Basin]], systematically exclude any peace negotiations.

Especially the mining town of Torar, where the goblins of Venture and Co. dig for [[Stoalium]] in the deepest mines, and Edforge, where the Thorium Brotherhood uses the dark shimmering ore to forge unique equipment, are key locations of the war. Hardly a year goes by without a change of power in the upper echelons of the centrals. The dwarves and goblins are unspokenly considered imun, as both parties are aware of their need for the goblins' technologies and the ancient smithing skills of the Thorium Brotherhood.

Although the forces of the [[League of Arathor]] recently came close to capturing the Desecrated Stronghold, the Horde's last stronghold, and were thus on the verge of bringing [[The Basin]] under the banner of the [[League of Arathor]], the momentum of the paladins was not enough and the Horde was able to lead an aggressive counter-attack that once again dispersed the [[Herbstbog]]-Torar Alliance.
