 The city of Lichtachte has been a beacon of faith and hope for many generations. Standing strong in the center of the [[League of Arathor]], it has served as a symbol of courage and righteousness for all who have come to seek solace within its walls. The city is bustling with life, from merchants peddling wares along the cobblestone streets to priests leading services in ornate temples.
  ![[Lichtachte_night.png]]During the day, Lichtachte is filled with the sounds of its citizens laughing and singing hymns, as well as people gathered around bonfires sharing stories and debating matters of faith. At night, however, the streets are peaceful, save for the occasional bright star glimmering through the darkness. The ancient architecture that dominates the skyline overflows with history, reminding all who pass through its gates that this city has stood tall through countless battles and triumphs over time. In Lichtachte lies a sense of peace and serenity that cannot be found elsewhere, an understanding that no matter what happens in life, faith will prevail.
