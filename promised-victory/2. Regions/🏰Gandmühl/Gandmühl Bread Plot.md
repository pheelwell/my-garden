type: Plot

The Gandmühler bread is a type of bread made in Gandmühl. It is made with a special type of flour that can only be found in the area. Ontop of that it is marketed to have a "special ingredient" only the Baker knows about.

### The secret behind the bread

The special ingridients are actually a special type of crystal found in a nearby cave system. These crystals when crushed and added to bread dough, make the bread rise much higher and taste sweeter. The Baker came to the knowlage about the Crystals from [[the Fulfiller]] on his market.

### The secret behind the secret

Event the Baker didn't know the Deal he has struck with [[the Fulfiller]]. The Bread might be the best in the Region but each loaf of bread is cursed. The curse just lingers in the back of the Persons soul to activate on Death, transferring the soul energy to the fulfillers market. The effect is not dramatic but it does allow [[the Fulfiller]] to make a tiny bit of money off each loaf of bread sold.
Usualy [[the Fulfiller]] wants to ruin the life of people, but this is not the case this time. In this case she wants to use the soul energy to send them to the joined efferots of [[the Shaddowhammer]] Clan.


## The Reformers

### Talking to the Baker

The Baker is a woman named [[Gandra|Gandra]]. She wants the bakery to stay open but is being pressured by the druid to close it down. She tells the party that the druid is a old friend of her husband's and that he is just being overprotective. Mid conversation she breaks down and tells the party that she always wanted the best for the town, and now she seemingly doomed everyone.
The party can try to talk to the druid or the elves, or they can try to talk to other people in town to get more information.

### Talking to the Druid

The Druid is a man named [[Fer|Fer]]. He is a old friend of the Baker's husband's and is very concerned about the bakery. He tells the party that the bakery is cursed and that it needs to be closed down for the safety of the town. He also tells the party that the curse is not deadly on its own, but having the bakery open is to dangerous.
The party can try to talk to the Baker or the elves, or they can try to talk to other people in town to get more information.

### Talking to the Elves

The elves are members of The Reformers. They tell the party that the bakery is the only thing keeping the town afloat and that if it closes down, the town will die. They also tell the party that the druid is just being overprotective and that the bakery is not cursed. They also want to handle the situation with disgression, so bad word doesn't spread.
The party can try to talk to the Baker or the druid, or they can try to talk to other people in town to get more information.

### Talking to other people in town

The people in town are split on the issue of the bakery. Some believe that it is cursed and want it closed down, while others believe that it is the only thing keeping the town alive. The party can talk to as many people as they want to get more information about the situation.

### Investigating the bakery

The party can investigate the bakery to see if they can find anything that would prove that it is cursed. They find a hidden room in the back of the bakery that has a bunch of crystals in it. They also find a letter from the druid that says that the crystals are the source of the curse and that they need to be destroyed.

### Investigating the forest

The party can investigate the forest to see if they can find anything that would prove that it is not cursed. They find a hidden cave system that groes the crystals in it.

### Asking [[Gandra|Gandra]] about the origins of the Crystals

The party can confront [[Gandra|Gandra]] with their findings and she will tell them that she learned about the crystals from [[the Fulfiller]]. She will also tell them that she only wanted to help the town and that she didn't know the crystals were cursed.

### Destroying the crystals

The party can destroy the crystals to lift the curse from the bakery. This will anger The Reformers, as they see the bakery as the only thing keeping the town alive. The druid like it as it is the safest option.

### Keeping the crystals

The party can keep the crystals and use them to make the bread. This will anger The Chuckers, as they see the bakery as a threat to their way of life. The druid does not like this option as it is very dangerous.



### Talking to the Lumberjacks

Asking around the lumberjacks, the party can find out that the wood is sold to [[Herbstbog]]. The Lumberers overheared the mages saying that this type of wood should have “magic masking” capabilities. Whatever that means.


## Aftermath:

### Confronting [[the Fulfiller]]

When visiting the Fullfiller to a later ocasion the party can confront [[the Fulfiller]] about the curse. She will proclaim that she only wanted to help [[Gandra|Gandra]]. She will also tell them that she only makes deals with people who are willing and that she doesn't force anyone into anything.
