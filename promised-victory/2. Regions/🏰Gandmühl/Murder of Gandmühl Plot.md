The City of Gandmühl was shook by the murder of Reyala Althammer a prodigy child of the city. The child parents were Marit Althammer, a elven musician and [[Tarwin Althammer]] a human Paladin.
While the child was growing up, it became clear that the child was prodigiously talented in the ways of music.
As the child grew, they became more and more skilled in their craft, and their music brought joy to the people of Gandmühl.
One night, tragedy struck. Reyala was found dead in their bed, seemingly killed in their sleep by a poison used by the [[Defilers]]. The whole city was devastated by the news, and a funeral was held for the young prodigy.
The case was investigated by a private detective, but they were unable to find any clues as to who the killer might be.

### Course of action

- An investigation is launched by the Gandmühl Guard. Reyala's room is searched for clues.
- The private detective named [[Tren Brattingham]] is hired by the family to investigate the case.
- The detective begins to question the family and friends of Reyala.
- The detective discovers that Reyala had been threatened by the [[Defilers]].
- The detective discovers that Tarwin had dissapeared after the death of his family.
- The detective finds out the poison of the [[Defilers]] was used.
- The detective concludes that Tarwin is the killer and that he killed Reyala in their sleep.
- The city council concludes that there is not enougth evidence to support the assumption
- The case rests cold

### Suspects

- [[Tarwin Althammer]] - Reyala's father and a human Paladin.
  Motive: Tarwin dissapeared after the death of his family, wearabouts are currently unknown.
- The [[Defilers]] - A group who are opposed to the people of Gandmühl.
  Motive: The [[Defilers]] Poison was used.


### The Truth

The murder 5 years ago was commited by Lambrecht, a researcher of the [[League of Paranormal Researchers|LPF]] that poisoned the child to provoke the [[nosem]] to show up. The [[nosem]] did not show up, as the child did not have strong unfulfilled ambitions, she already did rise to fame, but was getting tired of playing her instrument.

### Investigating the cold case

Since the murder is cold for 5 years now, it is very hard to find clues. The party used their abilities to find Lambrecht whereabouts. The party can find a listing in documents of the [[League of Paranormal Researchers|LPF]]:
"Reyala Althammer - no signs of [[Nosem]] - right after death - Hawk"
Hawk is the coverup name of Lambrecht, which can be found out by interrogating other members of the [[League of Paranormal Researchers|LPF]].
Once the party has found out Lambrecht's real name, they can track him down and confront him.

### Implications

Tarwin despair -> [[The Fulfiller|Fulfiller]] Seduces Tarwin -> Tarwin becomes Volair
