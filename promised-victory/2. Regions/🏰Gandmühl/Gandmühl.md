Gandmühl is a small town of 2000 people mostly populated by elves.
Most of the people live from forestry, but in the recent years, Gandmühl rose in popularity from a famous bread manufactured in a bakery inside Gandmühl. This is also heavly marketed throughout the town.
This divides the population of the town into two groups. One that wants to keep on trading wood and the other one wanting to expand tourism.
The town is in the middle of a cultural change, as the elves that have lived there for generations as lumberman are now being forced to adapt to the new world. The bakery has brought in a lot of new people, and the old ways of life are slowly being forgotten. This has caused a lot of tension between the two groups, and it is slowly tearing the town apart.

## Politics

The town is governed by a council of elves, with the head of the council being the mayor. The council is evenly split between those who want to keep the town's focus on forestry, and those who want to expand tourism. This has caused a lot of infighting and the town is currently in a state of political turmoil.
The two groups name themselfs "The Chuckers" and "The Reformers" witch has led to a lot of resentment between the two groups.

## Geography

Gandmühl is located next to a river in a forest. The town is surrounded by fields and forrest.
The Chuckers (The people who want to keep the town's focus on forestry) live on the east side of the town, while The Reformers (those who want to expand tourism) live on the west side.

[[Adventuring in Gandmühl]]


## The Harbors

The harbor is also divided between the two factions in town. The Chuckers use it to transport the lumber they sell to [[Herbstbog]]. The Reformers use it to bring in tourists.

### Travel to [[Herbstbog]]

The party can take a boat from Gandmühl to [[Herbstbog]]. The trip takes about three days.

## The Lumbermills

The lumbermills are the only source of income for the Chuckers. They are located on the east side of town. The Chuckers are very protective of the lumbermills and see them as the only way to keep the town afloat.
