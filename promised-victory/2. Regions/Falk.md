# Geography
This cozy town is located in the south of the Basins Forrest. to the west of  [[Düsternest]]. Most of the houses  are made of timber and there are a few small farms scattered about. There is only one road leading into Falk, and it is a dirt road that winds its way through the forest. The people here are friendly and welcoming, but they keep to themselves and rarely venture out beyond the town's borders.

The local economy is largely dependent on logging and hunting, though the townspeople occasionally engage in trade with merchants who come through. The town also has a small brewery and an apothecary shop. There is a tavern where people can gather and exchange stories.

Falk is also known for hosting a weekly competition of changing theme where everyone visiting the town can participate. Those competitions are liked by the locals due to their fun and exciting nature. The Event organizers get really unordinary and creative with the themes, and everything goes. Although really getting into it, the townspeople enjoy the participation in the competition and don't even care as much about who wins.
