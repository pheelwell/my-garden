The owner of the brickyard in Darkshire and Rensden's uncle. A grouchy old man who always rubbed his eyes in a very conspicuous manner and generally doesn't seem very hygienic. Rensden grew up with him. Rensden never wanted to be a farmer like him and therefore had a bad relationship with him. He always worked for him against his will, Rensden was more interested in the other peoples and science. He read more books than he helped in the field, among other things he learned a little Darnassian there. Rensden started his apprenticeship in Lordaeron when he was 14. David was not at all pleased with this and bore a grudge against Rensden.
