## Flaming Taverns Plot

This is an optional plot that the players can embark on to meet the Investigator [[Tren Brattingham]] that falsely accused [[Tarwin Althammer]] (now known as [[Volar]])of being guilty of murdering his Wife.

### Arriving at the Crimescene

The party arrives at a **burnt down house** Inside the city.

The towns guards investigate the place and a **man in a coat** arrives commands them to stop, because this is a crime scene.

A **man** is standing in the Ashes, **arguing with the guards** and pointing at stuff.

### Talk to the man in the coat

The man in the coat introduces himself as **[[Tren Brattingham]]**, a town investigator. The burned down House was a Tavern named **The burning Goose**.

It was said to be in **Rivalry** with **The flaming Chicken** outside the castle walls that also burned down **a week** ago.

While describing [[Tren Brattingham|Tren]], describe he **smells after burned soot**, but don't further mention that this conflicts with him first appearing on the crime scene.

[[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] tells the player to let him do the investigation, and asking them not to speak to his "client".

### Secret

The real arsonist is [[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] himself. He burned down the house, to make the town more interested in his work, so he could get more money.

[[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] set the fire to the flaming Chicken first, but didn't get to plant enougth evidence to get one of the tavern keepers arrested.

### Gandmühler Murder

[[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] was also the investigator that was Hired to investigate the Gandmühler Murder. There, he quickly judged [[Tarwin Althammer]] guilty and rallied up the people, to get a quick buck, overlooking the clues of the crimescene. If the party knows that, they can confront him with it.

[[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] will dismiss the party that it was a rouge [[The Lost Hops|dad]] that wanted to move on with his life. If the party reads his memory for more clues on the murder, they find that the Tarwin was devestated and see Trenn knowingly accusing Tarwin of the Murder. If they dig deeper, they find that [[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] met Tarwin a month later in [[Edschmied]]. There Tarwin tells [[Tren Brattingham|Tren]] that he also lost his wife and he knows he was framed. But he is ok with it, he will bring his loved one back, with all other casulties of the cruelties of this basin. He just has to draw enougth soul energy into the [[Titan Forges|titan forge]] below [[Edschmied]].

### Talk to the man pointing

The man is called [[Theodor Goose]] and he is the owner of the in "The burning Goose".
He claims that [[Berta]], the Owner of the flaming Chicken burned down his house because of envy.

### Investigating the burned down House

- **Two guards** are talking about [[Berta]] the Owner of the Flaming Chicken. They are saying that **[[Tren Brattingham|Tren]]** thinks she did it.

### Talk to the people in the city

The people in the city all say that they didn't see anything and that they were all in bed at the time of the fire.

### Talk to [[Berta]]

[[Berta]] says that she didn't burn down the tavern and that he has an ironclad alibi. She was reconnecting with her ex-husband called [[Brastal]].

She also offers the party one Platinum for finding out who did it, she will take even more money form the real arsonist.

### Rivalry between the two taverns

The two taverns were in Rivalship for a long time. It all started when [[Brastal]], [[Berta]]'s ex-husband, left her for another woman. [[Berta]] then opened the tavern to get back at him. Theodor soon after opening his Tavern hired [[Brastal]] as a head Chef and since then they have been in Rivalship with each other.

### Show the evidence to [[Tren Brattingham|Tren]]

If the players get to read the list somehow, they see that the paper with the list is a invitation to a party that [[Brastal]] is hosting in his new tavern "The Phoenix". The party is ongoing.
