This Rogue was born as the son of a High Voodoo Priest of his tribe in the Isles. He was always fascinated by Surviving in the Wild and Hunting. He always felt pressured of his legacy, to step in the shoes of his father, who was the main devotee of the Loa of death. This led to him having a strained relationship with his family. When he was of age, he left his tribe and home in search of adventure.
He eventually made his way to [[The Basin]], where for a brief time he made money by skinning animals and collecting hides. After a few Months he met a group of adventurers. He adventured with them for awhile, until he was ambushed by an old rival. He was framed for the death of his father and was forced to leave the group. He was able to clear his name, but his tribe still distrusts him.
During his time in [[The Basin]], he also learned that his sister Jaloren had gone missing. The loa of death told him that his sister was using his magic further the Rituals of [[the Shaddowhammer]]. He has been searching for her since, under the assumption she is mindcontrolled by the cult.
He has been using his skills as a hunter to try and track her down, but has been unsuccessful so far.
He is now traveling with the party in the hopes of finding his sister and stopping the  Shaddowhammer.

He is a [[Shadow Hunter|Shaddow Hunter]] Subclass
