The Shaddowhammer is a extreme offspring of the Cult of the Gifted. They share the same goal as the Cult, but decided to go a extremer and darker path by using the powers of [[Ilsensine]], an Eldrich deity. 
- Shaddowhammer recently grew 

They have been performing small sacrifices to try and please their god. But they are about to perform a much bigger one. They are going to sacrifice the city of [[Edschmied]] by using a magical bomb that will kill everybody in it. They think that this will please their god and that he will grant them their wishes. But what they don't know is that they are being used by the evil god [[Naruun]]. He is using them to escape his prison and will take over the world. The cult is going to be the downfall of the world if they are not stopped

## Structure of the Cult

The Cult is devided into 3 parts. The first part is the Inner Circle, which consists of the leaders of the cult. The second part is the Outer Circle, which consists of the regular cultists. The third part is the Army, which consists of the people that the cult has brainwashed into serving them. The cult has been gaining in power as more and more people join. They have been performing small sacrifices to try and please their god.
The cult has a strict hierarchy. The leader of the cult is [[Volar]]. Beneath him are the leaders of the Inner Circle. Beneath them are the leaders of the Outer Circle. Beneath them are the regular cultists. And beneath them are the people that have been brainwashed into serving the cult.
The cult is very secretive and only allows people that they trust into their inner circle. They are willing to do anything to achieve their goals and will stop at nothing to get what they want.

### Shaddowspire

The cult is based in the city of Shadowspire, which is located in the middle of the Endless Caves. Right ontop of the prison of their God. Since every tentacle was emerging from the physical core of [[Naruun]], every cave leads to the Shadowspire.
