[[The Moonfair]] made a pact with a group of fey creatures called the Gremlins who grant them their power in exchange for a place to stay. The fairies are the ones who make the carnival what it is. They use their magic to make the games fun, the food delicious, and the rides thrilling. They also use their magic to keep the carnival hidden from the outside world. On the downside, the fey are also mischievous, and their pranks can sometimes go too far.
The Contract with the Gremlins forbids the Fair from charging Money for the fair, in exchange for that the Gremlins provide the fair with everything they need to run the fair.
The Problem with the Contract lies in the small print which the Gremlins are known to take advantage of.
The contract's small print states that the Gremlins can take anything they want from the fair as long as they don't take more than what the fair can provide. This has led to the Gremlins taking things like the Ferris Wheel and other attractions without which the fair can't do. The Gremlins are also known to take people from the fair as well. They will often take children who get lost in the carnival. The Gremlins will also take people who they think are not having fun at the carnival.
Furthermore, the contract can only be lifted if the Gremlins are paid back everything they offered the carnival. This can be done in Money or other valuables.!
