# Backstory

[[Mom]] had always been a talented and inventive individual. She had grown up in a small village, where her love of tinkering with tools and inventing machines was well known. She quickly gained the attention of those in the town who sought to use her gifts for their own benefit, and she was coerced into helping them smuggle contraband into the city. Despite her reluctance, [[Mom]] soon proved to be an invaluable asset to their operation, and her reputation as an inventive genius grew.

It wasn't long before word of her deeds reached a mysterious underground organization that called themselves the Lost Hops. They sought to use [[Mom]]'s skills for their own benefit, and so they offered her a place among them. Seeing an opportunity to help others, [[Mom]] accepted their offer and became one of their leading members.

At first, [[Mom]] worked hard at mastering the subtleties of subterfuge and stealth that were necessary for successful smuggling operations. But it wasn't long before she began to see that the members of the Lost Hops needed more than just stealth - they needed protection from those who wished them harm. So she invented the [[Ritual of Name]] - a process by which members could erase memories of past identity so that no one would know who they were or where they had come from. This process ensured that no one outside of Lost Hops could harm them or threaten their safety in any way. 

The [[Ritual of Name]] soon became an integral part of Lost Hops operations, allowing them to carry out their smuggling activities with impunity and giving them an added layer of protection that even their enemies found hard to penetrate. Thanks to [[Mom]]'s ingenuity, the members of Lost Hops are now able to operate under cover in relative safety, while still providing much needed goods and services to those unable or unwilling to purchase from traditional supply chains.
