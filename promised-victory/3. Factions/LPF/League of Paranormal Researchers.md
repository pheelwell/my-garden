## Research about the [[Nosem]]

One Branch of the LPF is the [[Nosem]] Research Department, which is devoted to understanding the nature and purpose of the [[Nosem]].
The [[Nosem]] Research Department has been studying the [[Nosem]] for many years, and they have a lot of knowledge about them. They know that the [[Nosem]] are benevolent beings who help the [[souls of the dead]] to release their pent-up anxiety and move on to the afterlife.
They have trouble to get in Contact with the [[Nosem]], as they are very secretive, but they have managed to observe them at deathbeads on single ocasions.
Recently [[the Fulfiller]] gave some researchers some machinery to see into what happens at a near death scenario.
They observed that the [[Nosem]] are guiding the [[souls of the dead]] with unfulfilled ambitions through their last whishes.

### Dark Secrets

On the surface level, the research is very novel, but at the deeper levels of the LPF some academics take more drastic measures to get results.
The commitment goes as far as to intentionally poison people, who have high ambitions, to provoke the [[nosem]] to show up.  
Those experiments are keept under lock and key far away from other researchers and the public, as the method is highly unethical.
