Naruun is the old god of false promises, he was once a powerful deity, but was sealed away by the other forces of nature. He was imprisoned in a titanic prison, but has been manipulating [[the Cult of the Gifted]] to try and escape. He has been using them to sacrifice people and gather power. He is almost ready to escape, but the party needs to stop him.

# Appearance
In his physical Form Naruun appears as a infinite purple mass of giant tentacles, that burry into the land.
In his visions he looks like a giant clouded concept of an Angelic figure with multiple Wings.

# Taking Influence
The god of false promises works in finding out the deepest desires of people and then granting them the power to seemingly achieve those desires and wishes.
He starts out by appearing as a being of great benevolence, helping [[the cult of the Gifted]] in their pursuits. For example, he promises them the power to resurrect the dead, and they believe that he is the true god of death.

# History

## Peak of Power

Naruun wasn't always sealed. The Sealment was a response to him gaining too much power.
Thousends of Years Ago Naruun was at the peak of his power, manifested into his physical form his tentacles dug through the whole basin.
Beneath his tentacles there were giant cults of his following, which blindly followed his command.
They would do everything to make their lord happy, even if it meant killing innocent people and sacrificing them to him. The other forces of nature saw this and decided that something had to be done. They used their power to seal him away in a titanic prison, where he would be unable to escape.

## The Sealing

The forces of Nature, Arcane, Chaos, Light and Death gathered their power to create a seal that would hold the old god.
Naruun was imprisoned in a prison made out of the very fabric of reality. The prison was designed to be inescapable and to hold him for all eternity.
The Titans built 3 Forges distributed throughout [[The Basin]], that were used as Focal points of the Life, Death and Chaos Artifacts.
To power the forges, the [[Nosem]] channeled energy from the Plane of Death into them.
After the sealing the Artifacts were spread out and the Titans removed their knowledge of the Forges from History.

## Break the Prison

The only way to break the prison is to gather all artifacts. The Artifacts need to be placed in their spots in the Forges and provide the necessary soul energy.
If this is done, Naruun will be set free and will start a reign of terror.
The party needs to stop the cult before they can free Naruun and cause untold destruction. They need to convince [[Volar]] of the error of his ways and stop the ritual. Once Naruun is freed, the party will need to deal with the god directly and seal him away again.

# Involvement in the Basins Conflict
The conflict in [[The Basin]] had been raging on for decades, with no end in sight. Little did the citizens know that a sinister force was at the heart of it all. Naruun was manipulating events from the shadows in order to break free from his prison and wreak havoc upon the land.
