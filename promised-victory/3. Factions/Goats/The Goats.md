A Small incision here, a cut there. A few moments later the mercenary holds the eye of a hyppogryph in his hands. "This will fetch a good premium." he whispers to himself and slits away his scalpel.
He steps away from the corpse of the hyppogryph, its body almost torn to shreds, but around the head the fur is clean and the cuts barely bleed.

The mercenary makes his way back to town, eager to fulfill his contract.

### Structure of the Goats

This shady mercenary organization has specialized in organ harvest and ~~illegal~~ creative medical procedures. They have been in business for years and have a wide network of contacts.

The organization is run by a small group of upper management, called cooks. Below them are the middlemans, called the Stitchers. Under them are the foot soldiers, called Cutters. And at the very bottom are the apprentices of the cutters Bleeders.

The borkers are the ones who acquire the contracts and manage the prices. The stitchers hold the communication between cooks and Cutters and are responsible for logistics. The Cutters are the ones who actually do the surgeries. And the bleeders are the ones who dispose of the bodies.

The organization is very hierarchical, with a clear chain of command.

The Goats are in a conflict with the  [[Lost Hopps]] Since they follow opposing goals. 

The two factions are currently in a stalemate, neither able to

#### Goals of the Goats

The Goals of the Goats are twofold.

The first goal is to make money. They do this by selling the organs they harvest on the black market.

The second goal is to advance the state of medical knowledge. They do this by conducting experiments on the organs they harvest.

#### Methods of the Goats

The Goats are a very efficient organization. They have a well-oiled machine that they use to harvest organs and conduct experiments.

Cooks have ~illegal~~ creative contracts with clients, who are usually desperate. The clients provide the Goats with information on the subject, and the Goats provide the clients with a list of organs that they are willing to harvest.

Cooks and Cutters don't communicate directly. All communication is done through middlemans called stitchers.

Stitchers are the ones who actually do the surgeries. They are very skilled and have a lot of experience.

After the surgery, the stitcher wraps the harvested organs in a bag of holding enchanted with a freezing spell, that keeps the organs fresh for transport.

The organs are then given to the Stitchers at a agreed on place.

The excange is made subtly to not bring any attention on the operation.

If the Stitchers have aditional contracts, they exchange them at that moment in form of a little pamphlet they give to the Cutter with the agreed amount of money.

The Cutters then move on to their next job.


### The Apprentices

The Apprentices are the lowest rank in the organization. They are the ones who dispose of the bodies.

They are also the ones who do the grunt work.

The Apprentices are also the ones who are most likely to be caught by the authorities.

### Symbol of the Goats

The symbol of the Goats is a goat's head with a curved knife in its mouth.

### Inner Circles

After some time, cutters can buy their way into the inner circle of the organization. There they learn new and illegal creative ways of harvesting organs and conducting experiments.

The Inner Circle is a group of Cutters who have proven themselves to be the best at what they do. They are the ones who are given the most difficult and delicate jobs.

They are also the ones who are given the most dangerous jobs.

At that time, the Opeartions also go over to the aquiring of humanoid organs.

The cutters in the inner circle are also the ones who know the most about the Goats and their operations. But still, the contact to the Cooks is very limited.

### The Mutagen

Once inside the Inner Circle, a mutagen is offered to the Cutter, that bestows the lycanthropy curse on him. This makes the Cutter stronger, faster and tougher. It also makes him more resistant to pain.

The downside is that the Cutter will slowly become more and more animalistic. The longer he takes the mutagen, the harder it will be for him to control his transformation.

The Cutter will also become more aggressive and bloodthirsty.

The mutagen is a well-kept secret of the Goats and only the Cutters in the inner circle know about it.

### Plot Hook
The PCs are hired by a mysterious benefactor to infiltrate the Goats and retrieve important information about their operations.

They must be careful, as the Goats are a powerful and ruthless organization. If they are caught, they will face certain death.
The PCs must use their skills and wits to infiltrate the organization and uncover its secrets.
