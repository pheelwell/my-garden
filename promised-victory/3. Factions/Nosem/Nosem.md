The Nosem are astral entities guiding the spirits of the deceased with unfulfilled ambitions through their last whishes.
They live right behind the gates of the afterlife, where they travel on flying ships in the stream of souls running into the afterlife.
In the Stream of souls, the Nosem look for souls that died with strong feelings of unacomplishment. Those kind of Souls are "fished" out of the stream by a net and the Nosem help the soul to let go of their past. They guide the soul through the mortal realm one last time with the lost soul and given the souls ambition is in good faith sometimes even alter things so that the ambitions are not lost.
That way they can help the souls to release their pent up anxiety and let go of their life, in the process releasing energy that the Nosem use to fuel their ships and nourish themself.
The Nosem are benevolent beings that want nothing more than to help others. They are often seen as guardians, watching over those who have died and guiding them to the afterlife. They are kind and compassionate, always looking out for the best interests of those they help.

The Nosem live in small families on their ship and have a rivalry between each other. Placed further down the stream of souls means that there are less and less souls to be guided and therefor less energy to be gained from them, going so far as not being enough energy to sustain the Ship and the onboarding crew. This leads to a lot of fighting for the Nosem for the best positions.
The Nosem have no concept of time and live in the moment. They are often seen as playful and carefree, but they take their responsibilities very seriously. They are always ready and willing to help those who need it, and they will never give up on someone they are trying to help.

## Ships of the Nosem

The Nosem live on flying ships that are powered by the energy of the lost souls they help. The ships are beautiful and magnificent, and they are designed to float in the steady stream of souls.
The ships are said to be very comfortable and luxurious, and they are said to have all the amenities that the Nosem need.
On the Sides of the ship the Nosem mount their large nets, fishing for the souls of the unaccomplished dead.
The ship it self never leaves the stream of souls but can go faster or slower deepening on how much energy the onboarding Nosem need.
The ship has a captain and a crew of Nosem, and each ship is different.
Some ships are large and luxurious, while others are small and more humble.
The size and design of the ship depends on the preferences of the captain and crew.
The ships are always clean and well-maintained, and they are said to be very comfortable to live on.
The Nosem are a happy and content people, and they enjoy helping others. They are always ready and willing to help those in need, and they will never give up on someone they are trying to help.
